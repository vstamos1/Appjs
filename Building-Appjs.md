There are two main ways to prepare a machine to be able to compile the appjs source code. One involves using the [MozillaBuild](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild) environment, check the appjs forums for information on this method. The other method is documented here. We start from a completely new install of windows 7 and then go through all of the necessary steps to get a full working environment.

The first step involves creating a working npm environment that is able to compile C++ modules.
* Go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) and click on the install button to get the latest version of node.
